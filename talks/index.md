        BriteLines - BriteCon 2018
    </a>
</h2>

At BriteCon 2018 I gave a talk on BriteLines, which is one of the projects I currently lead at BriteCore.

In this talk, I demonstrate the capabilities of BriteLines to our customers. This includes:

* Defining insurance products
* Data modeling insurance products with Fields and Coverages
* Rating insurance products with Rate Tables and Calculations
* Inheriting product definitions across multiple states
* Versioning products over time
