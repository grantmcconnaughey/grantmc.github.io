At BriteCon 2018 I gave a talk on BriteLines, which is the project I currently lead at BriteCore.

In this talk, I demonstrate the capabilities of BriteLines to our users. This includes:

* Defining insurance products
* Data modeling insurance products with Fields and Coverages
* Rating insurance products with Rate Tables and Calculations
* Inheriting product definitions across multiple states
* Versioning products over time
